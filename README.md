# Fourier-Series
MATLAB project to demonstrate Discrete time Fourier series


PART A: Synthesis

The discrete-time periodic sequence will be based on last 4 digits of your CMS IDs
For example, assuming student_A has digits "0459" as the last four digits in his/her CMS ID. The other student, student_B, has "2034".
Then, you need to first plot the 4 periodic sequences (representing the four frequencies existing in this time-domain sequence, based on student_A ID). The scaling factor of each of these frequencies will be based on the student_B's ID.
Then,  you need to add these 4 sequences to obtain the summed (synthesised) sequence.

PART B: Decomposition/Analysis 

Start now with the synthesized sequence. Your job is now to decompose this signal, and find out the FS coefficient of each of the constituent signals :)
If you do it correctly, then you should obtain FS coefficients matching with the CMS ID of student_B.
